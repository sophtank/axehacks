# Introduction
Welcome to MeloMetrics. This is a project completed for the 2024 GirlsWhoCode AxeHacks Hackathon. This was the first hackathon for all five of us and we were very excited to make this much progress in 12 short hours.  Our project was data visualization, and we chose to visualize Spotify data of music popularity from the 2000s to now.
Data visualization was done via Tableau, and the website was created with a combination of Python, HTML, CSS, and Flask.
